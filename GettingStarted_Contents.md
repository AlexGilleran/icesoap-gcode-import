# Getting Started #
The Getting Started guide takes you through each step of the process of using IceSoap. It assumes you have a basic knowledge of how to work with Java and Android.

  1. **GettingStarted1** Identifying the requests and responses of your target service, using SoapUI
  1. **GettingStarted2** Creating `SOAPEnvelopes` based on the requests you identified in GettingStarted1.
  1. **GettingStarted3** Creating the classes you want to have retrieved and annotating them to work with IceSoap
  1. **GettingStarted4** Tying your envelopes and response classes together with `Request`s
  1. **GettingStarted5** Putting everything together and using IceSoap in your app.

The guide is long for something labelled "Getting Started", but the idea is to provide you with everything you need to know to get started with it. If I've missed something important, please make a comment or shoot me an email.
